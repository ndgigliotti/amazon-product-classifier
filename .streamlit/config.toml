# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.

# DataFrame serialization.

# - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow but battle-tested.
