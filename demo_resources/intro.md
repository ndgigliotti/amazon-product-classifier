### Business Problem

Suppose Amazon wants to add 100K new products to their online selection. Each product has data provided by its supplier; it has a title, brand, description, and category. Amazon needs to assimilate those products into their existing classification scheme. This could take days of tedious human labor, or minutes of machine time.

### Demonstration
